# Artifact Three Narrative

## Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
The artifact used within this category of enhancement is the same as the first enhancement. It is a full stack single page application (SPA) that displays trip information for a vacation booking website. The SPA is meant to provide an easy-to-use UI for server-side CRUD functionality, so that administrators of the site can add, view, modify, and delete trip data as needed. Data is contained within a MongoDB database as the project was based around the MEAN stack. The front end UI of the SPA was constructed using the Angular framework and its components in compliance with the MEAN stack as well. This artifact was originally completed during CS-465: Full Stack Development as the final project of the course.
## Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How did the enhancement improve the artifact? What specific skills did you demonstrate in the enhancement?
Previously mentioned in the narrative of the first enhancement, this artifact was chosen because it was not functional by the time it was submitted in the CS-465 course. This was due to logic conflicts between versions of the Angular framework used to build the SPA’s components, and the version the guide utilized within the course materials. Because the project remained incomplete once the course had finished, I had hoped to address the logical errors present within the SPA. So that I could have a working full-stack application to add to my portfolio as was the original goal of the course. Regarding the SPA’s components, its nature as a full-stack application requires the usage of various front and back-end development skills. These include the ability to design and implement database structures, establish database management tools (CRUD functions), create RESTful APIs, design easy to use user interfaces, utilize multiple development languages, etc. Because the SPA is based on the MEAN stack, different technologies and frameworks were required throughout development. Showing capability to adapt these technologies together through problem solving and critical thinking skills. After enhancment, the SPA now has a functioning UI with the ability to add, edit, and view data contained within a MongoDB database using a simple UI tool. The skills demonstrated by this enhancment are much the same as those demonstrated by the artifact's components. The enhancment required each of the components to be reimplemented one-by-one, requiring the the ability to design and implement database structures, establish CRUD functions, create RESTful APIs, design simple user interfaces, and code in multiple development languages.
## Reflect on the process of enhancing the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face? How did you incorporate feedback as you made changes to the artifact? How was the artifact improved? Which course outcomes did you partially or fully meet with your enhancements? Which do you feel were not met?
While improving upon this artifact, I learned about JSON webtokens and their role in validating user credentials when performing login. How when new entries are added to a database for login credentials, a JSON webtoken is generated with a valid signature to reference for authentication purposes. This knowledge can then be used in future projects requiring JWT generation and authentication. The main challenge during this enhancement was that the login page would not accept the JWT, labeling the token variable used for JWT generation as undefined. Even though tests in Postman would return a JWT upon posting login credentials, and the code contained definitions of the token variable. I could not find any useful information on how to address this issue either, which led me to restarting the project from an earlier branch for this enhancment and the first. But after doing so, I was able to get the artifact to connect to the MongoDB database properly to display data. From there, I added the components to display the data in the SPA's UI and the functions to manipulate it. As for course outcomes, I planned to meet course outcome number two with this enhancement. Course outcome two refers to the ability to design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. Because the main page UI is now functional, the artifact successfully delivers professional visual communications that are technically sound and coherenet to an audience. In this case, the audience would be the admin users of the SPA's vacation booking website.
## Running this Program
To run this program, each of the files included in this repository must be added under a new root directory folder. The name of this folder can be anything but the one used throughout the project's development was "travlr". Then the following software will need to be installed to get the code to run properly.
1. Node.js and Node Package Manager
2. MongoDB and MongoDBCompass
3. Postman
4. Angular Command Line Interface

Once installed, the program can be run from the Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell by changing directory to the root folder of the project and typing "npm start". This will start the server of the program and establish its connection to the MongoDB database on localhost:3000. Opening a second Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell window and changing directory to the "app_admin" folder under the project's root folder and typing "ng serve" will start the SPA on localhost:4200. Then opening a browser and entering the localhost:4200 url will navigate to the SPA to add, edit, and view trip data contained in the MongoDB database.
